#######################The react webpage walkthrough#################
<b>WHAT IS THIS WEBPage? </b>

<b> Brief WebPage Outline: </b>

This is a react take home task for Veryable. Here I have designed the frontend for displaying the users in a workspace. I have tried to make this simple webpage as userfriendlt as possible.

Required Features:
Displaying the users in a page.
Having collapsible card which displays the detailed information about the user.
Displaying user icon with different colors based on their roles.

**_Added Features_**

- I have added light mode and dark mode to the webpage so that it will be easir for admin to access page based on their preference
- I have added the global search bar on the top, making it easier for admin to search based on name, address, phonenumbers or other users features
- I have added the dropdown on top which separates the users based on roles so that admin can easily search candidates based on their roles
- There is global expand more button on the top, that will expand all the cards at once if needed to see the detailed view.
